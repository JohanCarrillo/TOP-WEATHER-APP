# About
This is an exercise project proposed at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) to learn how to use API calls and asynchronous functions in javascript.
The API used to get the geolocation and weather data is [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org).

# How to use
Just write the name of the city you're looking for in the search bar and press "search" or the enter key. The page wont do anything if you write a city that doesn't exist because it internally throws an error in the console.

# How to install
To install thep rogram for development just install node dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
